# Creating a character
**Step 1:** Decide on a name and concept for your character.

**Step 2:** GM awards starting Character Points (CP) in two categories:

**CP Categories:**
- **Combat CP:** HP (Tough perk), combat skills, combat-related perks
- **Non-Combat CP:** Social, knowledge, crafting, wilderness skills, and related perks
Both types can be spent on learning spells.

**Step 3:** Spend CP on skills, perks and spells. Each purchase shows (Attribute1) or (Attribute1/Attribute2) indicating which attributes benefit. CP spent creates attribute points that you allocate between the listed attributes. When attributes reach tier thresholds (10/30/60/100/150), you gain +1 to that attribute.

**Step 4:** Calculate bonus actions:
- **Mental Actions:** Every 5 total Mental attributes (Perception + Will + Charisma + Wit) = +1 Mental Action
- **Physical Actions:** Every 5 total Physical attributes (Might + Endurance + Agility + Dexterity) = +1 Physical Action

**Step 5:** Select starting gear and calculate final statistics:
- **HP:** Max Toughness × (5 + Armor) + Extra HP
- **Initiative:** 2d10 + Perception
- **To hit and Damage** based on equipment and attributes 
- Speed -  calculated as 5+Agility+(Running/2 rounded down)+Bonuses-Penalties 
## Costs
[[5. Skills]]  - are progressed by paying increased 2/+4/+6/+8/+10 price for each update.

Domains -  such as #Spellcraft or [[1. Martial Domains]] like One-Handed Weapons Domain are Skills following different progression rules.

To progress domains you need to purchase spells (for Spellcraft) and Perks (for both).
Perks and Spells apply to Attributes **and** Domains.
Perk can have multiple domain selection. like in attributes you select one on learning it.
 The progression becomes:  
 - Regular Skills: Direct CP purchase (2/4/6/8/10 or similar)  
 - Domains: Progressed by learning domain abilities  
   - #Spellcraft Domain: 10/+20/+30/+40/+50 via learning spells and as mentioned in [[6. Magic System]] are gated by skills. 
   - [[1. Martial Domains]]: 5/+10/+15/+20/+25 via learning combat techniques/perks.
