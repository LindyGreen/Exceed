## Medical Treatment Categories
### No Medical Treatment Required

- **Time to escalate**: Doesn't escalate
- **Treatment:** Any type of healing or first aid will remove the lasting mechanical conditions. First-aid check is automatic success.
- **Recovery**: Natural: Without healing the visual consequences will last for 1d6 unmodified days and don't require rest. 
### Medical Attention Required
- **Time to escalate**: 1h.
- **Escalation prevention**: First Aid or any healing prevents escalation and suppresses the condition.
- **Treatment**:  Treating wounds or analogue magic is required to proceed to recovery phase. On a failure, consecutive check has +1 stacking DC and can be attempted twice.
- **Recovery:** Regaining the wound and removing the condition requires 1d6 hours unmodified rest after treatment or 1d6 days without it.
- **Escalation:** Roll Endure vs Treatment DC. On failure, escalate to next severity bracket or GM determines complication.
- **Re-injury penalty:** If wounded again before completing rest, this consequence reopens alongside new consequence. 

### Medical Intervention Required

* **Time to escalate**: 10 minutes.
- **Escalation prevention**: First Aid or any healing delays the escalation for an hour and stops persistent bleeding if present. Treat wounds can delay the escalation by a day. 
- **Treatment**: Surgery or analogue magic is required to proceed to recovery phase.  Failure leads to escalation.
- **Recovery:** 1d6 days unmodified rest.
- **Escalation:** Roll Endure VS treatment DC, on a failure escalate to a Medical Emergency
- **Re-injury penalty:** If wounded again before completing rest, gain a medical emergency.

### Medical Emergency

- **Escalation prevention**: Treating wounds or analogue magic delays the escalation to an hour.
- **Treatment:** Surgery or analogue magic is required to proceed to recovery phase. Failure during this phase leads to death.
