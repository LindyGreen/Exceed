# Costs
Perk Costs by Level:  
 - Level 0: Cheap (2), Average (3), Expensive  
 (5) - Basic techniques  
 - Level 1: Cheap (3), Average (5), Expensive  
 (10) - Refined skills  
 - Level 2: Cheap (5), Average (10), Expensive  
 (15) - Advanced techniques  
 - Level 3: Cheap (10), Average (15), Expensive  
  (20) - Master techniques  
 - Level 4: Cinematic effects (arbitrary costs)  
  - Legendary techniques

This cost logic is applied to both Spellcraft and Martial Domains. Despite Martial domains requiring half the cost, the other half in Spellcraft can be substituted by spells.

| Large weapon   | 3-5 kg  |     |
2h weapons being heavier then 1h on average. Some weapons remain nimble despite that, so an average weapon Like a greatsword (yes, its not about KG weight but that it is quite fast) can weight like a heavy one.

## Encumbrance Simulation
**Average human (MG0/EN0, 0 CP invested):**
- Capacity: 25 kg, No penalty threshold: 12.5 kg

**Early Character (MG1/EN1, 20 CP invested):**
- Capacity: 49 kg, No penalty threshold: 24.5 kg

**Early-Mid Character (MG2 or EN2):**  
- Capacity: 64 kg, No penalty threshold: 32 kg

**Sample Loadout:**
- Kite shield: 5 kg + Defensive armor: 8 kg + Average weapon: 2 kg + Secondary weapon: 2 kg + Basic equipment: 5 kg = **22 kg total**

**Results:**
- Starting character 12kg = no encumbrance penalty
- Early character: 22 kg = no encumbrance penalty
- Early-mid character: 22 kg + 12 kg additional gear = 34 kg = light encumbrance

Adding daily food/water (1 kg) pushes characters toward light encumbrance during travel.
