**Requirements:** #GM, **Tags**: #Instant 
**Attribute:** #WL  **Cost:** 5 CP  
## Description
Everyone wants to bend reality to their will. Unlike most you can, because **you** are a *mage*. 
Perhaps you were trained by a journeyman or a master mage, paid to try to awaken your talent. Or maybe, like most mages, during your important event in life, your talent awoken. 
You might have been a child lost in the darkness who summoned light or adapted own eyes to see in it, a pilgrim who's legs were so tired that all you wanted was for your backpack to become weightless, or maybe you saw your loved ones dying and willed their wounds to stop bleeding. 

## Mechanics
* Select a Tier 0 spell. Add it to your repertoire. This spell doesn't contribute to attribute advancement.
* You unlock Tier 0 spells to be able to add them to your repertoire.
* You can learn Team Ritual in one day provided written guidance or an hour provided a help of someone who knows it. This is highly common knowledge.
* This perk requires no time to learn, requires GM permission as per #GM trait and the GM may decide to grant it to you at any given time up to his discretion, bending the reality.
* You can select this perk as a part of a background, but to unlock it in a controlled state GM might require Arcane Lore 1/Theology 1 and a magical instructor (tier 2 or higher, at least legally).
