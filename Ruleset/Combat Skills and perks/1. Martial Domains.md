## Martial Domain progression
Any character can use any martial weapon by adding an appropriate to the weapon attribute.

Martial progression has an increasing cost of reaching further levels.

### Perk Entries format
Martial perks entries include (Attribute/Attribute 2, Domain/Domain 2) entries. If an entry includes more then 1 domain, you can - like in attribute - select domain towards which the points will goes. If it states [AnyDomain] - you are free to select any combat domain of your choosing.
