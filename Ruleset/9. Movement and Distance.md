Exceed uses meters as the standard unit of  measurement for all game calculations. Whether you play on a hex grid, square grid, or use theater-of-the-mind rules, all distance values in the game represent meters. 
Characters' spaces are the area their characters occupy. It can be represented by the token on a grid-less map, a square or a hex character occupies.

  In combat movement there are 3 movement actions. Each spends 1 AP.
  1 - [[Step]] - Move 1M, you don't provoke reactions with it. Can step towards an enemy as a part of a melee attack.
  2 - [[Stride]] - Move (Speed)/2 rounded up.
  3 - [[Run]] - After striding you can turn into a run, moving your full speed in a movement. 

Movement Speed - in game references as just Speed as 5+Agility+(Running/2 rounded down)+Bonuses-Penalties
