### Weapons list
#### Melee weapons
Reading the weapons entry - Name, Damage die as per combat rules (skill increasing n of damage dice, magic changing the weapon in other ways), Traits - a bit outdated, but should work. Power requirement leads to -1 to hit per point of deficit. Critical - extra effect on crits.

Heavy and Two handed weapons will have heavier and lighter variants. But weapon building and special materials won't be a thing during the play-test stage 3. 
#### Ranged weapons
**Designer's Note**: 
- Bow damage varies based on Power requirements. An unfit bow (one in which you lack power) will have a minus to hit equal to Power-Power.req, a fit or lower power req. bow one will do extra damage equal to it's Power requirement.
- Longbows will have trait heavy in later iterations, #TODO and we will have light heavy and medium speed bows. But that is outside the scope of PT4.

Range Increment - For weapons without the Aim trait (such as thrown weapons), range increments are equal to the weapon's Range value. For weapons with Aim X trait Range Increment = X.

| Weapon   | DMG         | Power Req | Traits                  | Crit  |
| -------- | ----------- | --------- | ----------------------- | ----- |
| Shortbow | 4+Power Req | -1 to 5   | Aim 10, Range 5,        | Pin 1 |
| Longbow  | 5+Power Req | 0 to 5    | Aim 20, Large, Range 2, | Pin 2 |

Reading the entry - Armor penalty combines with Armor's Armor penalty. Negation entry is for abilities that prevent the damage. Defense bonus applies to all mundane defenses. Magical shields apply to spells as well. 
- Different shield types use different stats for blocking.
Light shields uses Agility, Medium use Endurance and Heavy Shields use Might. This trait is also attached to the shield boss.

### Accessories
[Rings, amulets, etc. with magical effects]


### Consumables
[Potions, scrolls, single-use items]
Tier 0-5 Spells can be put into forms of potions and scrolls. Scrolls require a Spellcraft perk or Arcane Theology skills to use, potions don't. That's why on the upcoming table of bottled and inked spells bottled are twice the price.
These are irrelevant for the stage of play-test 3.

## Mundane Equipment
Irrelevant for the purposes of the play-test stage 3.

[Professional tools, survival gear]
