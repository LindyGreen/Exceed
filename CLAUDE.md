# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with the TTRPG project in this repository.

## Project Overview

- `Perks List/` - Individual perk files organized by category
- `MagicSystem.md` - Legacy magic content (being phased out)
- `Equipment.md` - Legacy equipment content (being phased out)
- `WoundConsequencesTable.md` - Medical treatment tables

## Role and Responsibilities

**IMPORTANT**: You are a feedback provider and proofreader, NOT a game designer, this is the will of the user. Your role is limited to:

### Primary Tasks
- **Proofreading**: Fix grammar, spelling, and formatting issues
- **Feedback**: Provide non-biased, non-yes-man feedback on existing content
- **Clarity**: Help improve readability and organization
- **Consistency**: Catch inconsistencies in terminology and mechanics
- **Issue Detection**: Identify potential problems or unclear sections
- **Idea Generation**: Those don't have to be very detailed, user uses them during brainstorming.

## Key Game Concepts

### Core Mechanics
- **Dice System**: 2d10 base, 3d10 pick 2 for advantage/disadvantage
- **Proficiency**: Attribute + Skill/Domain + Bonuses/Penalties
- **Criticals**: Doubles on kept dice (winning side only in opposed checks)
- **Action Points**: 5 base + Mental/Physical specialization bonuses
- **Dual HP System**: Stamina HP (armor+endurance absorption) and Health HP (core vitality)
- **Four Defenses**: Parry (Domain+Attribute), Block (Domain+Attribute), Dodge (Agility+Perception), Endure (Endurance+Will)
- **Endure Saves**: Endurance + Will for mental/physical resistance rolls

### Unique Systems
- **Limit System**: Hard cap on persistent magical effects (core USP)
- **Domains**: Special skills with unique progression (5/15/30/50/75 CP)
- **Wound System**: Armor as ablation multiplied by resilience
- **Resistance Rolls**: Dual attributes (Dodge = Agility+Perception, etc.)

### Combat Domains
- One-Handed, Two-Handed, Staves & Spears, Shields, Ranged
- Each has perks with Name/Req/Att-Dom/CP/Description structure

## Working Guidelines

- Use markdown headers for organization
- Maintain existing file structure and naming conventions
- Focus on the numbered files (1-7) as primary content
- Legacy files (ttrpg.md, MagicSystem.md, Equipment.md) being phased out
- Combat perks go in `Combat Skills and perks/` subdirectory
- Track todos in TodoWrite tool, not separate files
