## Health System



## Health and Damage

### Calculating Your Health

**Base Resilience** = Focus + Health + 2
**Damage Threshold** = Base Resilience + Armor Bonus
**Total Wounds** = 2 + Health 
**Total HP** = Damage Threshold × Total Wounds 

### Damage Zones

**Temporary Wounds** (First half of wounds, rounded down)
- No penalties to actions
- Recover  after scene or with abilities.

**Serious Wounds** (Remaining wounds)  
- Each level: -1, -2, -3... penalty to all actions
- Require medical treatment
- At Max Wounds, character is incapacitated(unless stated otherwise)

**Fatigue:**
Each time gaining a level of fatigue leads to lowering max HP by 1 row of temporary wounds.
Character can become fatigued up to level of Temporary wounds, falling unconscious if pushed beyond that level.


#### Example
Health 2, Focus 1, Armor Bonus 3:
- Base Resilience: 5 (vs mental/necrotic)
- Damage Threshold: 8 (vs physical, HP per wound)
- Total Wounds: 4
- Total HP: 32
- Superficial Wounds: 2 (no penalty)
- Serious Wounds: 2 (penalties -1, -2)


### Recovery

**Temporary Wounds**
- **Cannot recover while any Serious Wounds remain**
- When no Serious Wounds exist:
  - Full recovery after scene
  - Half recovery during short breather (10+ minutes)
  - Can be restored by certain abilities

**Serious Wounds**
- Each Serious Wound takes 1 week to heal naturally
- Can be accelerated using medical treatment, potions, and healing abilities
- Medical treatment can convert Serious Wounds to Temporary Wounds
- **Must be healed before Temporary Wounds can recover**

**Healing Limitations**
- Medical treatments have daily limits per patient
- Potions have daily limits per person
- Natural healing cannot be accelerated without intervention

#### Example Recovery
Character with 2 Temporary Wounds and 1 Serious Wound:
- **Cannot rest to recover the 2 Temporary Wounds**
- Must receive medical treatment to heal the Serious Wound first
- After Serious Wound is healed, Temporary Wounds recover normally
- Alternatively, medical treatment could convert the Serious Wound to Temporary, allowing normal rest recovery
