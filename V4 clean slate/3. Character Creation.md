**Step 1:** Select a name and concept for your character.

**Step 2:** GM awards starting Character Points (CP) in two categories:

**CP Categories:**
- **Combat CP:** HP (Tough perk), combat skills, combat-related perks
- **Social CP:** Social, knowledge, crafting, wilderness skills, and related perks

**Step 3:** Spend CP on skills and perks. Each purchase shows (Attribute1) or (Attribute1/Attribute2) indicating which attributes benefit. CP spent creates attribute points that you allocate between the listed attributes. When attributes reach tier thresholds (10/30/60/100/150), you gain +1 to that attribute.

**Step 4:** Calculate bonus actions:
- **Mental Actions:** Every 5 total Mental attributes (Perception + Will + Charisma + Wit) = +1 Mental Action
- **Physical Actions:** Every 5 total Physical attributes (Might + Endurance + Agility + Dexterity) = +1 Physical Action

**Step 5:** Select starting gear and calculate final statistics:
- **HP:** Max Toughness × (5 + Armor) + Extra HP
- **Initiative:** 2d10 + Perception
- **Movement and damage based on equipment and attributes**
