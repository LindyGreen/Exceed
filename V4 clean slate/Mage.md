**Requirements:** GM, **Tags**: #Instant 
**Attribute:** #WL  **Cost:** 5 CP  
## Description
Everyone wants to bend reality to their will. Unlike most you can, because **you** are a *mage*.  
During an important event in your life, your talent awoken. You might have been a child lost in the darkness who summoned light or adapted own eyes to see in it, a pilgrim who's legs were so tired that all you wanted was for your backpack to become weightless, or maybe you saw your loved ones dying and willed their wounds to stop bleeding. 


## Mechanics
* Select a Tier 0 spell. Add it to your repertoire. This spell doesn't contribute to attribute advancement.
* You unlock Tier 0 spells to be able to add them to your repertoire.
* You can learn Team Ritual in one day provided written guidance or an hour provided a help of someone who knows it. This is highly common knowledge.
* This perk requires no time to learn, but GM may decide to grant it to you at any given time up to his discretion, as GM helps your character to bend the reality to their will.
* You can select this perk as a part of a background, but to unlock it in a controlled state GM might require Arcane Lore 1/Theology 1 and a magical instructor (tier 2 or higher, at least legally).
