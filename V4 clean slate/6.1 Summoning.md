SO, the idea on summoning. 
You need a perk like - Necrodancer or Furry lover or Demon Pet owner. 
Or its a ritual. 

So the first phase to earn a summon is to perform a ritual by robbing a grave, or having necromantic fun with the bodies of your enemies, cleaning them of flash or making a pact with a demon/angel/otherworldy being fitting the setting.
You bind them with a ritual and now they follow you around.

But they need magic to operate, here comes the spell (that usually comes with the ritual) to bind them and feed them from your limit. 
Summon AP cost is the cost to summon them from where they are to your world. You can summon any type of a summon once per combat. So basically you can throw a lot of bodies on the floor. 

Idea basically is - you spend actions to phase in and out creatures into reality, they operate semi-independently and consume your limit. If they die, you have to change the configuration, but you cannot summon the defeated ones. 

A perk like necrodancer who each tier can summon more undead or druid who can do same with animals.
Those from 1 type will always operate as 1 unit. For now.


Sounds op - countered by a few AOE spells.
