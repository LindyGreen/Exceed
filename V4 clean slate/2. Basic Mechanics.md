# Core Resolution System
## Dice
In Exceed checks are resolved with d10 dice.
Normal Dice Roll is 2d10. Roll with an advantage is 3d10 pick 2, roll with a disadvantage is 3d10 keep 2 lowest. 
Criticals work through doubles. Doubles on the kept 2d10 can turn successes into a critical success, and failures into a critical failure.
## Rolling dice
Ability Roll result = Dice + Skill+Attribute + Bonuses/Penalties
Resistance Roll results = Dice +Attribute1+Attribute2+Bonuses/Penalties
#### Unopposed checks 
Compare Roll result with the Difficulty Class (DC). if Roll result >= DC -> Success. Otherwise fails.
Doubles on the Dice turn success into a critical success, and a failure into a critical failure.
#### Opposed checks
If Offender's roll result is >= Defender Roll Result -> Offender Succeeds. Otherwise Defender Succeeds.
If the succeeding party's Dice roll was a double, succeeding party critically succeeds.


**Skill Application:**
- **Direct skill use:** Full skill bonus (e.g., Dancing to dance)
- **Raw attribute:** Attribute only, no skill bonus (e.g., Agility only to dance gracefully)
- **Related skill:** GM assigns -1 to -3 penalty based on how related (e.g., Fast-talk at -2 to cover bad dancing)
- **Creative alternatives:** GM discretion on penalty for unconventional approaches

Notes
**Key Features:**
- Skills and attributes capped at 5 for bounded accuracy, all math calculated, all graphs beautiful as they can be
- Positive feedback loop: Higher skills → higher attributes → better performance with related skills
- Players choose which attribute to increase when raising skills
- GM determines appropriate skill/attribute combinations and situational penalties
