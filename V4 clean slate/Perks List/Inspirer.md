## Description
After succeeding at a check, you can inspire an ally to perform better on their next similar attempt.

## Mechanics
- Requires you to attempt the check first in the group
- After your success, use your reaction to give your skill bonus to the next ally
- Ally must attempt the same or very similar check to benefit
- Uses your reaction, so only one ally can benefit per round
- Represents coaching, encouragement, and sharing techniques
- Particularly effective for skill challenges and group problem-solving
- May not work if too much time passes between your success and their attempt
- Bonus applies only to the next attempt, not ongoing effects
- GM determines when checks are similar enough for the bonus to apply
