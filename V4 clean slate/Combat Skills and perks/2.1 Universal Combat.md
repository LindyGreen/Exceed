Notes:
Two birds - two birds is impaling 2 guys with a pointy end and swiping at them in one feat. No reason to make it 2 feats. 

# Feat Ideas
Paired feats like Cult Leader/Inner Member
Hero/Hero's party
Master/Apprentice
Veteran/Rookie
General/Officers

Only the Leader takes the CP cost. and while working together, they provide benefits. 
E.g. Veteran/Master making Rookie's/Aprrentice's CP grow faster or turning downtime into CP.
