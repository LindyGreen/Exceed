## Combat Resolution
## Action Economy

**Base Action Points:** 5 AP per turn for all characters and one Reaction[R]. Using a reaction reduces the number of AP on the start of the next turn by 1. If you have Reactive or other perks allowing multiple reactions - reduce the number of actions by number of reactions used.

**Specialization Bonuses:**
- **Mental AP:** Every 5 total points in Mental attributes (Perception + Will + Charisma + Wit) grants +1 Mental AP
- **Physical AP:** Every 5 total points in Physical attributes (Might + Endurance + Agility + Dexterity) grants +1 Physical AP
- Mental AP can only be used for mental actions: spells, social interactions, knowledge checks, perception, concentration
- Physical AP can only be used for physical actions: movement, attacks, athletics, manual tasks

### Determining Initiative

- **Standard Encounters:** Initiative = 2d10 + Perception. This reflects awareness, reaction time, and mental preparedness when combat begins unexpectedly. 
- **Ambushes or Prepared Battles:** When initiating an ambush, you can roll relevant skills.
- **Ties:** Players go first in case of ties, for others - up to GM.
- **Modifiers:** Spells, abilities, and circumstances can provide bonuses to initiative rolls.
- **Delaying:** Done before the beginning of your turn to a predetermined point, only once per round. All beginning/end of turn effects are delayed with your action.

### Surprise Rounds

- **Ambush Coordination:** Ambushing side rolls initiative as one group using their leader's roll, representing coordinated surprise attacks.
- **Stunned Targets:** Ambushed combatants who roll 5 or lower than the ambush leader become Stunned 3 (lose first 3 actions, cannot use reactions) as they process the situation.
- **Ambush Sites:** Favorable ambush locations can provide bonuses to the ambush initiative roll.

Magic weapons can have an attribute and limit requirement. They will provide the basic bonus to attacks, but won't provide other benefits like an increased die size, extra damage type, magical effects etc.

The action cost can be modified, combined or compressed with appropriate combat perks.
