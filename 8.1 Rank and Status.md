#Rank is your formal standing in organized and semi-organized structures.
Ranks exist in many forms - such as ranks in priesthood, magical accreditation, military and administrative ranks, nobility ranks etc.
It provides access and support from the organisation, but as well as might lead to organization requesting support from the PC, on a threat of losing said rank or soiling reputation within the organisation.

Ranks are free perks with levels. Those can be given as a result of player actions - like raising though military hierarchy, passing medical exams , but are not worth character points and don't increase any attributes. Rank levels may require an appropriate skill level to be awarded in any competent structure.
Ranks sometimes can be bought, but not with CP, but money and favors.
