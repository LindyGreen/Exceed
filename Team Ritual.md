Mage can conduct a simple 1 minute  Ritual with willing targets to form a team or include someone in a team. This allows mage to apply team effects on his allies while they are in his general viscinity (for playtest it's the same scene, later I will make distance rules) allies lose the effects while away and regaining while near. This also allows the mage to cast harmful effects on his allies without resistance. To break away from the team you need to spend a full round on your turn. Some state that the ritual is built that way, so parties won't screw supports over loot.
