## Combat Resolution
## Action Economy

**Base Action Points:** 5 AP per turn for all characters and one Reaction[R]. Using a reaction reduces the number of AP on the start of the next turn by 1. If you have Reactive or other perks allowing multiple reactions - reduce the number of actions by number of reactions used.

**Specialization Bonuses:**
- **Mental AP:** Every 5 total points in Mental attributes (Perception + Will + Charisma + Wit) grants +1 Mental AP
- **Physical AP:** Every 5 total points in Physical attributes (Might + Endurance + Agility + Dexterity) grants +1 Physical AP
- Mental AP can only be used for mental actions: spells, social interactions, knowledge checks, perception, concentration
- Physical AP can only be used for physical actions: movement, attacks, athletics, manual tasks

### Determining Initiative

- **Standard Encounters:** Initiative = 2d10 + Perception. This reflects awareness, reaction time, and mental preparedness when combat begins unexpectedly. 
- **Ambushes or Prepared Battles:** When initiating an ambush, you can roll relevant skills.
- **Ties:** Players go first in case of ties, for others - up to GM.
- **Modifiers:** Spells, abilities, and circumstances can provide bonuses to initiative rolls.
- **Delaying:** Done before the beginning of your turn to a predetermined point, only once per round. All beginning/end of turn effects are delayed with your action.

### Surprise Rounds

- **Ambush Coordination:** Ambushing side rolls initiative as one group using their leader's roll, representing coordinated surprise attacks.
- **Stunned Targets:** Ambushed combatants who roll 5 or lower than the ambush leader become Stunned 3 (lose first 3 actions, cannot use reactions) as they process the situation.
- **Ambush Sites:** Favorable ambush locations can provide bonuses to the ambush initiative roll.
